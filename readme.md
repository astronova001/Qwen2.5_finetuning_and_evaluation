# Qwen 2.5 Text Finetuning

This repository contains everything needed to finetune the Qwen 2.5 model for text processing tasks. It includes configuration files, training scripts, sample datasets, and evaluation tools.

## Contents

- **Configuration Files**: Definitions for model parameters, training hyperparameters, and dataset paths.
- **Training Scripts**: Python scripts to start, monitor, and evaluate the training process.
- **Datasets**: Sample files and instructions to prepare your own data.
- **Evaluation Tools**: Scripts and notebooks for testing model performance post-training.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**  
    Run the following command:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Qwen_2.5_text_finetuning.git
    cd Qwen_2.5_text_finetuning
    ```

2. **Setup Environment**  
    Create and activate a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```
    Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

- **Data Preparation**: Follow instructions in the dataset folder to prepare your text data.
- **Model Finetuning**: Execute the training script with appropriate parameters:
  ```bash
  python train.py --config config/train_config.yaml
  ```
- **Evaluation**: After training, assess the model using:
  ```bash
  python evaluate.py --model path/to/trained_model
  ```

## Customization

Adjust configuration files in the `config` folder to tailor:
- Learning rates
- Batch sizes
- Number of training epochs

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure all required dependencies are installed.
- Check configuration paths if encountering file not found errors.
- For further assistance, open an issue on the repository.
